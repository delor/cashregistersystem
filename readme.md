#CashRegisterSystem

##Goal
The Cash Register System is a backend of the system for managing the service of fiscal devices. With its help, you can keep records of devices, customers, service technicians or installation locations. All this, thanks to the use of API, online from a computer, smartphone or tablet.

Currently, the project includes only a part of the backend along with the shared APIs.

The motivation to create such a tool is an attempt to implement the functionality of a desktop application, which I use on a daily basis, and to learn technologies useful in everyday work as a web developer.
